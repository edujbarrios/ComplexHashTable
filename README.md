# ComplexHashTable üóÉÔ∏è

Welcome to ComplexHashTable! This project implements a complete and functional hash table, taking into account various dispersion and exploration functions.

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory:

2. Execute `make` in your terminal to compile and run the project.

3. Once the program is running, press option 4 (`usage`) to see how to use the hash table.

If you want to see a demonstration of the correct functioning of the hash table with random values, navigate to the `/RandomValuesDebug` directory.

Please note: The hash table is designed to handle elements of 8 digits, which is equivalent to inserting Spanish National Identification Numbers (NIFs).
